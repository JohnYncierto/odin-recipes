    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 lb ground beef (80% lean)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon black pepper</li>
        <li>4 hamburger buns</li>
        <li>4 slices of cheese (optional)</li>
        <li>Lettuce, tomato, onion, pickles (optional)</li>
        <li>Ketchup, mustard, mayonnaise (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
        <li>Preheat your grill or skillet to medium-high heat.</li>
        <li>In a bowl, gently mix the ground beef with salt and pepper. Be careful not to overwork the meat.</li>
        <li>Divide the mixture into 4 equal portions and shape them into patties about 3/4 inch thick. Make a slight indentation in the center of each patty to prevent it from puffing up during cooking.</li>
        <li>Place the patties on the grill or skillet. Cook for about 3-4 minutes on one side, then flip and cook for another 3-4 minutes on the other side for medium doneness. Adjust the cooking time if you prefer your burgers more or less cooked.</li>
        <li>If using cheese, place a slice on each patty during the last minute of cooking to melt.</li>
        <li>Toast the hamburger buns on the grill or skillet for about 1 minute until lightly browned.</li>
        <li>Assemble the burgers by placing each patty on a bun and adding your favorite toppings and condiments.</li>
        <li>Serve immediately and enjoy your homemade burgers!</li>
    </ol>
