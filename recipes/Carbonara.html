    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>200g spaghetti</li>
        <li>100g pancetta or guanciale, diced</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>50g Pecorino Romano cheese, grated</li>
        <li>50g Parmesan cheese, grated</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, peeled and left whole</li>
        <li>Salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>Fresh parsley, chopped (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the spaghetti and cook according to package instructions until al dente.</li>
        <li>While the pasta is cooking, heat a large skillet over medium heat. Add the diced pancetta or guanciale and cook until crispy, about 5-7 minutes. Add the whole garlic cloves and cook for an additional 1-2 minutes to infuse the oil, then remove and discard the garlic.</li>
        <li>In a bowl, whisk together the eggs, Pecorino Romano, and Parmesan cheese. Season with a pinch of salt and a generous amount of freshly ground black pepper.</li>
        <li>Once the pasta is cooked, reserve about 1 cup of pasta water and then drain the spaghetti.</li>
        <li>Add the hot spaghetti to the skillet with the pancetta. Toss to combine and coat the pasta in the rendered fat.</li>
        <li>Remove the skillet from heat and quickly pour in the egg and cheese mixture, tossing vigorously to create a creamy sauce. If the sauce is too thick, add reserved pasta water a little at a time until you reach your desired consistency.</li>
        <li>Serve immediately, garnished with additional grated cheese, freshly ground black pepper, and chopped parsley if desired.</li>
    </ol>
